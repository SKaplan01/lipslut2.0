# Lipslut

Lipslut.com sells makeup to benefit progressive causes. The site is built with GatsbyJS, GraphQL, and AWS Lambda Functions.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

As interns for working on lipslut.com, we updated the navigation bar and added dynamic components for the product details page, ingredients list, and voting popup.

I also really enjoyed helping to create a data visualization of lipstick sales in each state (see below). Lipslut is a product with a progressive mission and the team was surprised by the geographic breakdown of the sales data. Our goal was to create a visual representation of the data that would highlight purchases that occurred in these surprising states.

Another goal was to ensure a fast build time while processing a large dataset. We used Gatsbyâ€™s onPreBootstrap lifecycle method to run a function in Node that read and aggregated thousands of lines of sales data from a csv before building nodes to create the data visualization, which shaved almost two minutes off the build time.
