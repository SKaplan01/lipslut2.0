# Lipslut

Lipslut.com sells makeup to benefit progressive causes. The site is built with GatsbyJS, GraphQL, and AWS Lambda Functions.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Dynamic Components

As interns for working on lipslut.com, we updated the navigation bar so that, as the product team adds new batches of lipstick to the CMS, the navbar will automatically render an accurate dropdown menu with all lipsticks currently for sale. We also added dynamic components for the product details page, ingredients list, and voting popup.

## Data Visualization

I also really enjoyed helping to create a data visualization of lipstick sales in each state (see below). Lipslut is a product with a progressive mission and the team was surprised by the geographic breakdown of the sales data. Our goal was to create a visual representation of the data that would highlight purchases that occurred in these surprising states.

Another goal was to ensure a fast build time while processing a large dataset. We used Gatsbyâ€™s onPreBootstrap lifecycle method to run a function in Node that read and aggregated thousands of lines of sales data from a csv before building nodes to create the data visualization, which shaved almost two minutes off the build time.
